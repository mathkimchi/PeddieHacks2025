## Inspiration
Deep voice narrator: "In a world where less than ten percent of Americans eat a balanced diet but over 60 percent of them play games"
CEO guy (which is going to symbolize us): "We decided to build a game to teach teenagers about a balanced diet. since teenagers have the lowest average HEI score but 85 percent of them play games weekly, we thought a simple game to teach the value of balancing grains, fruits, vegetables, and proteins would be a straightforward way of educating the youth about healthy eating habits. *suddenly serious* Well, that was before they found out"
Scientist guy who sounds like he knows what he's talking about and also sounds like he's exposing a conspiracy: "the whole thing's a pyramid! It goes all the way to the top!"
CEO: "Based on scientific evidence that proved it was not necessary, we decided to take it out of the major food groups"
Scientist: "Over half the world! Lactose intolerant"
CEO: "Oh, you want us to clarify which food group? It's-"
Scientist: "BIG MILK! They bought their way into the food pyramid!"

Documentarian: "so you made a game about fighting big milk while promoting the 4 actual major food groups?"
CEO: "Yeah"
...
Ending:
Narrator: "Coming to you, (not in theaters because its a video game), Udder Lies"
What it does
spread awareness at this misconception in a way that hopefully will be more entertaining 
How we built it
visual aspects were created in blender such as the animations and the sprites and the actual logic works through Godot and GDScript. 
Challenges we ran into
I have never really worked with 2D blender before mostly having experience with 3D so I had to learn a lot of things on the fly. As for the game itself we also didn't have much 2D game experience so we faced many new bugs and challenges like which camera is getting priority. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Used sectional comments
Used abstraction
Updated our custom documentation book while coding
Not a single git merge conflict
Played diep.io with leo pan wang
Used GitHub issues
Used labels for bare minimum features as well
The animations in general
Consistantish artwork
## What we learned
Art is hard, people are lactose intolerant, everything always boils down to pyramids. 
## What's next for Udder Lies
If we had more time we would definitely add more levels that are more fleshed out as we ran out of time for that. Also visually there were still a lot of things I would have liked to try such as making the bars more interesting.
